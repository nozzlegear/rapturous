Gearworks is a template for new Shopify apps using the "CETR" stack â€” CouchDB + Express + Typescript + React. Gearworks is fully equipped for handling Shopify's OAuth process and webhooks out of the box, so you can skip straight to building the real meat of your application.

**This app template is a work in progress. Please check back soon!**
